1. Cost Model
The cost model defines how costs are structured and categorized.

Cost Categories
Infrastructure Costs (Compute, Storage, Networking)

Virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine)
Object storage, block storage, and backup solutions
Data egress and inter-cloud transfer fees
Platform Services

AI/ML services (e.g., SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML)
HPC (High-Performance Computing) clusters for simulations
Data ingestion and pipeline tools
Software & Licensing

Proprietary modeling and simulation tools (e.g., MATLAB, Ansys, Simulink)
Open-source tools with enterprise support
Development & Support Costs

DevOps pipelines, CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
API gateways and integration layers
Managed Kubernetes and container orchestration
Security & Compliance

Identity & Access Management (IAM)
Compliance monitoring tools (e.g., AWS Security Hub, Azure Defender)
Operational & Management Costs

IT staff, DevOps engineers, cloud architects
Monitoring and observability tools (Datadog, New Relic)
2. Showback Model
The showback model provides transparency by allocating costs to departments, projects, or users without enforcing direct billing.

Key Metrics for Showback
Usage-Based Cost Allocation

Compute: Hours of CPU/GPU usage per user/project
Storage: TB stored and retrieved per team
Network: Data transferred per cloud region
Per-User/Per-Team Breakdown

Show detailed resource consumption per user or team
Highlight underutilized resources for optimization
Tagging & Labeling Strategy

Use cloud-native tagging (e.g., AWS Cost Allocation Tags) to track cost by project
Optimization Insights

Recommendations for cost savings (e.g., reserved instances, rightsizing)
Identify inefficient workloads
Example Showback Report for a Team:

Team	Compute Cost	Storage Cost	Network Cost	Software Licenses	Total Cost
AI Team	$5,000	$1,200	$800	$3,500	$10,500
Simulation Team	$6,500	$1,500	$1,000	$4,200	$13,200
Development Team	$3,200	$800	$500	$2,800	$7,300
3. Chargeback Model
The chargeback model enforces cost recovery by billing departments or users for their actual usage.

Chargeback Strategies
Direct Consumption-Based Billing

Bill based on actual resource usage (e.g., compute, storage, network traffic).
Subscription Model for Shared Resources

Departments pay a fixed monthly fee for access to shared resources (e.g., common AI/ML tools, HPC clusters).
Tiered Pricing Model

Tiered charges based on resource consumption (e.g., $0.10 per CPU-hour up to 10,000 hours, $0.08 per CPU-hour beyond that).
Cost Allocation by Project or Business Unit

Assign costs based on estimated or actual project needs.
Example Chargeback Table
Business Unit	Compute (CPU/GPU)	Storage (TB)	Networking (Data Transfer)	Software Licenses	Support Fees	Total Charge
AI Research	$10,000	$3,000	$2,000	$4,000	$1,500	$20,500
Simulations	$12,000	$4,500	$3,000	$5,000	$2,000	$26,500
Software Dev	$7,500	$2,500	$1,500	$3,500	$1,000	$16,000
Incentives for Cost Efficiency
Discounts for Prepaid/Reserved Resources (encourages long-term commitments)
Charge Penalties for Unused Reserved Resources (discourages over-provisioning)
Showback-First, Then Chargeback Approach (gives teams time to optimize before enforcing chargebacks)
